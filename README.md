# Math, Numeric Computing, and JavaScript

> Talk for [csv,conf,v3][csvconf].


## Abstract

JavaScript and number crunching may seem an odd pair, but this is rapidly changing. In this talk, I will discuss the current state-of-the-art for numeric computation in JavaScript and highlight emerging technologies and libraries for neural networks and multidimensional data structures. I will discuss what to look for in numeric computing libraries, common implementation mistakes, and how to avoid portability issues. I will explain why JavaScript is poised to become the next big thing for data science and numeric computing. And to conclude, I will outline future steps and identify opportunities for community development of next-generation tools.
